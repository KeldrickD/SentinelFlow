# SentinelFlow — Project Overview

SentinelFlow is an autonomous onchain operations engine built using the Chainlink Runtime Environment (CRE).

It monitors onchain and offchain signals, evaluates policy rules, and executes deterministic onchain actions with full audit logging.

Primary use cases:
- Risk management
- Contract pausing
- Treasury controls
- Automated ops workflows

SentinelFlow is not a DAO.
SentinelFlow is not an AI decision-maker.
SentinelFlow is a deterministic infrastructure runtime.
